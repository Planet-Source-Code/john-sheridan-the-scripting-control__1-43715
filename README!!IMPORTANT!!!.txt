To use the spreadsheet program's functions, do this:

=5*7   would turn the cell into 35
=Round(A1, 2)   would round A1's value to the hundreds digit
=Mid("Hello.", 2, 2)   would return "el"


*note: you can view and edit the current cell's formula in the little blue box @ the top left

Please vote! I put a lot of work into this :-P.
